          <p>Munchkin brings you the essence of the dungeon-crawling experience. . . without all that messy roleplaying!
This game includes 168 cards, one six-sided die, and these rules. Three to six can play. You will need 10 tokens (coins, poker chips, whatever – or any gadget that counts to 10) for each player.</p>

          <h2>Setup</h2>
          <p>Divide the cards into the Door deck and the Treasure deck. Shuffle both
decks. Deal four cards from each deck to each player.</p>

          <h2>Card Management</h2>
          <p>Keep separate face-up discard piles for the two decks. You may not look through the discards unless you play a card that allows you to! When a deck runs out, reshuffle its discards. <span style="font-weight:bold">In Play:</span> These are the cards on the table in front of you, showing your Race and Class (if any) and the Items you are carrying. Continuing Curses and some other cards also stay on the table after you play them. Cards in play are public information and must be visible to the other players.
            <span style="font-weight:bold">Your Hand:</span> Cards in your hand are not in play. They don’t help you, but they can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand.” At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand (see Charity, p. 2). Cards in play may not be returned to your hand – they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them.</p>

          <p>Everyone starts as a Level 1 human with no class. (Heh, heh.) Munchkin characters may be either male or female. Your character’s sex is the same as your own at the start of the game, unless you declare otherwise. Look at your initial eight cards. If you have any Race or Class cards, you may (if you like) play one of each type by placing it in front of you. If you have any usable Items (p. 3), you may play them by placing them in front of you. If you have any doubt about
whether you should play a card, you could read below, or you could just charge ahead and do it.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Decide who goes first by rolling the dice and arguing about the results and the meaning of this sentence and whether the fact that a word seems to be missing any effect.
Play proceeds in turns, each with several phases (see p. 2). When the first player finishes a turn, the player to the left takes a turn, and so on. The first player to reach Level 10 wins . . . but you must reach Level 10 by killing a monster, unless a card specifically allows you to win another way.</p>

        <header id="main-headers">Turn Phases</header>
        <article>
          <p>Your turn begins as soon as the previous
player’s turn ends. When your cards are arranged the way you want, go to phase 1.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Kick Open the Door:</li>
            <p>Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up. If it’s a monster, you must fight it. See Combat,
p. 3. If the card is a curse – see Curses, p. 5 – it applies
to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has
a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an
upcoming effect). If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately</p>
            <li>Look For Trouble/Loot The Room:</li>
            <p>If you fought a monster in phase 1, skip this phase and go to phase 3. If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.
              <span style="font-weight:bold">Look For Trouble:</span> Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster you can’t handle, unless you’re sure you can count on getting help (see p. 4)!
              <span style="font-weight:bold">Loot The Room:</span> Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.</p>
            <li>Charity</li>
            <p>If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below – for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it’s up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.
As soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player’s turn begins.</p>
          </ol>

      <section class="main-section" id="character_stats">
        <header id="main-headers">Character Stats</header>
        <article>
          <p>Each character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.”</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Level:</li>
            <p>This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.</p>
            <li>Class:</li>
            <p>Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or
Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already. Each Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability. See the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting – and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on! You can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don’t wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card. You may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card. </p>
            <li>Race:</li>
            <p>Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.
Humans have no special abilities. The rules for Classes, above, also apply to Races. You may not belong to more than one race at once
unless you play the Half-Breed card.</p>
          </ul>

          <h3>Super Munchkin and Half-Breed</h3>
          <p>These cards may be played whenever
it is legal to play a Class or Race, as long as you have an appropriate card (Class for Super Munchkin, Race for Half-Breed) to attach it to. You cannot have more than one of the same Class or Race card in play at once. If you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with penalties against that Class suffer those penalties) and none of the disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it – you aren’t that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed, just for Races.)</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="treasures_&_items">
        <header id="main-headers">Treasures & Items</header>
        <article>
          <p>Treasure cards include permanent and “one-shot” cards. Any Treasure card may be played to the table as soon as you get it, or at any time on your own turn except during combat (unless the rules below or the card itself says otherwise).</p>

          <h2>Items</h2>
          <p>Most Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item. All Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your
Items during a combat or while running away. Anyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and
two “1 Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time. Likewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.
You cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster’s Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!
            <br />
            <br />
            <span style="font-weight:bold">Big Items:</span> You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability. If something lets you have more than one Big item (for instance, the Dwarf race) and you lose that ability, you must either correct the problem immediately or get rid of all but one Big item. If it’s your turn and you’re not in combat, you can sell the excess Big items (as long as you have at least 1,000 Gold Pieces of Items to sell). Otherwise, you must give them to the lowest-Level player(s) who can carry them! If any Big items are still left over, discard them.
            <br />
            <br />
            <span style="font-weight:bold">Trading:</span> You may trade Items (but no other cards) with other players. You may only trade Items from the table – not from your hand. You may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in combat – in fact, the best time to trade is when it’s not your turn. Any Item you receive in a trade must remain in play. You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players – “I’ll give you my Flaming Armor if you won’t help Bob fight that dragon!” You may show your hand to others. Like we could stop you.
            <br />
            <br />
            <span style="font-weight:bold">Selling Items for Levels:</span> At any point during your turn except during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (“No Value” cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard (for instance) 1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don’t get change. But if you can manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are carrying. You may not sell Items to go to Level 10.</p>

          <h2>"One-Shot" Tresures</h2>
          <p>A Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot” Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved. One-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.</p>

          <h2>Other Treasures</h2>
          <p>Other Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Up a Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level! Hireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however</p>

        <header id="main-headers">Combat</header>
        <article>
          <p>To fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers – positive or negative – given by Items and other cards. If the monster’s combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster’s – note that monsters win ties! – you kill it and go up a level (two levels for some big monsters). You’ll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card. Sometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without
killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don’t get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly. Some monster cards have special powers that affect combat – a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to
check these!</p>
